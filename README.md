# BoulderDash Game - Multiplayer using Java RMI

Multiplayer was made for Distributed Systems class at University Fernando Pessoa in Oporto, Portugal.

The game follows the client-server model and was created based on SinglePlayer. Be aware, there are some bugs related to thread's hung causing lag while playing. This project was developed to not-be a final version but a working version based on some solutions given by our coorinator.
